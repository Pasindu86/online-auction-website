# Auction Page Navigation Fix

## Issue
When clicking "Place Bid" on auction cards from the home page, users were seeing "Auction Not Found" error page.

## Root Cause
The .NET API backend is not running (Exit Code: 1), causing all auction fetch requests to fail.

## Changes Made

### 1. Home Page (`src/app/page.js`)
- ‚úÖ Auction cards properly wrapped in `<Link>` to navigate to `/auction/[id]`
- ‚úÖ Entire card is clickable (not just the "Place Bid" button)
- ‚úÖ Added better error handling with three states:
  - **Loading**: Shows spinner with "Loading auctions..." message
  - **Error**: Shows "Auctions Not Found" with error details and "Try Again" button
  - **Empty**: Shows "No Live Auctions Available" with helpful buttons

### 2. Auction Detail Page (`src/app/auction/[id]/page.js`)
- ‚úÖ **Improved error page** when auction fails to load:
  - Better visual design with Gavel icon
  - Clearer messaging: "Unable to Load Auction" instead of harsh "Auction Not Found"
  - Explanation of why it might have failed
  - **Two action buttons:**
    - "Back to Auctions" - returns to auction list
    - "Try Again" - retries loading the auction

## How Navigation Works

```
Home Page Card
    ‚Üì (Click anywhere on card)
Auction Detail Page (/auction/[auctionId])
    ‚Üì (Place bid form available)
User can place bid
```

## To Fix the API Issue

The backend API needs to be running for auctions to load. Run:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\repo -acurion\online-auction-website\AuctionSystem.Api"
dotnet run
```

Once the API is running at `http://localhost:7001`, the auction pages will work properly.

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- ‚ùå Harsh "Auction Not Found" error
- ‚ùå No retry option
- ‚ùå Confusing messaging

### After:
- ‚úÖ Friendly error messages
- ‚úÖ "Try Again" button to retry loading
- ‚úÖ Clear explanation of the issue
- ‚úÖ Multiple navigation options
- ‚úÖ Better visual design

**Status**: Ready to test once backend API is running! üöÄ
